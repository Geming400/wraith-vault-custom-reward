# Backups

Doing a backup of your save file can be important here, as for example, if you give yourself golden keys, you wouldn't want it to be forever in your save file *(right ?)*

In geometry dash, there are 2 saves files:
- `CCGameManager.dat` *(your main save file, contains your stats, icons, etc...)*
- `CCLocalLevels.dat` *(your local levels)*

Here the one we want to backup is `CCGameManager.dat`.

## Finding where your save file is located

Your save file is **always** located at `%localappdata%\GeometryDash` *(even if you have a pirated version of gd)*

## Making a backup of it

Making a backup of your save file is really easy actually !

Just copy `CCGameManager.dat` somewhere.

### Oops, I did not make a backup of my save file! What do I do ?

Don't worry about that, you can replace your `CCGameManager.dat` file by the `CCGameManager2.dat` file.

> [!WARNING]  
> This will only work if you launched gd **only 1 time** after doing your actions ! However, if you really need to modify your save file back, follow those 2 ressources: [ressource 1](https://wyliemaster.github.io/gddocs/#/topics/localfiles_encrypt_decrypt?id=decryption) ; [ressource 2](https://wyliemaster.github.io/gddocs/#/resources/client/gamesave)

## Putting your backup as your save file

*(I think you can guess by yourself how to do that, but i'm still going to include it anyway)*

Once you need to load the backup of your save, just replace your save file *(which is located in `%localappdata%\GeometryDash`)* by your backup !
